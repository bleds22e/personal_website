Using over two decades of rodent community data from a long-term experiment, we show that a small, ubiquitous granivore (Chaetodipus penicillatus) shifted its use of different experimental treatments with the establishment of a novel competitor, C. baileyi. Shifts in residency, probability of movement between patches, and the arrival of new individuals in patches altered which treatment supported the highest abundances of C. penicillatus. Our results suggest that the establishment of a new species worsened the quality of the originally preferred treatment, likely by impacting resource availability. Paradoxically, the presence of the new species also increased C. penicillatus’ use of the less preferred treatment, potentially through shifts in the competitive network on those plots.","tags":"","title":"Temporal changes in species composition affect a ubiquitous species’ use of habitat patches","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556337600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556337600,"objectID":"efb6b0701d584970dca4184edf1b259e","permalink":"/project/builds/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/builds/","section":"project","summary":"A community for includive pedagogy and open education resources.","tags":["DEI Work"],"title":"B(ui)LDS","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556337600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556337600,"objectID":"ed8d35956e8740784df2d5b02fa12ed7","permalink":"/project/portalr/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/portalr/","section":"project","summary":"R package for using Portal data","tags":["Software","Long-term Dynamics"],"title":"portalR","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ellen K.

We developed a workflow for a long-term ecological study that addresses many of the challenges associated with managing this type of data. We do this by leveraging existing tools to 1) perform quality assurance and control; 2) import, restructure, version, and archive data; 3) rapidly publish new data in ways that ensure appropriate credit to all contributors; and 4) automate most steps in the data pipeline to reduce the time and effort required by researchers. The workflow leverages tools from software development, including version control and continuous integration, to create a modern data management system that automates the pipeline.","tags":"","title":"Developing an automated iterative near-term forecasting system for an ecological study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

As a result, many available ecological forecasts are not based on the most up‐to‐date data, and the scientific progress of ecological forecasting models is slowed by a lack of feedback on how well the forecasts perform. Iterative near‐term ecological forecasting involves repeated daily to annual scale forecasts of an ecological system as new data becomes available and regular assessment of the resulting forecasts. We demonstrate how automated iterative near‐term forecasting systems for ecology can be constructed by building one to conduct monthly forecasts of rodent abundances at the Portal Project, a long‐term study with over 40 years of monthly data. This system automates most aspects of the six stages of converting raw data into new forecasts: data collection, data sharing, data manipulation, modelling and forecasting, archiving, and presentation of the forecasts. The forecasting system uses R code for working with data, fitting models, making forecasts, and archiving and presenting these forecasts. The resulting pipeline is automated using continuous integration (a software development tool) to run the entire pipeline once a week. The cyberinfrastructure is designed for long‐term maintainability and to allow the easy addition of new models. Constructing this forecasting system required a team with expertise ranging from field site experience to software development. Automated near‐term iterative forecasting systems will allow the science of ecological forecasting to advance more rapidly and provide the most up‐to‐date forecasts possible for conservation and management. These forecasting systems will also accelerate basic science by allowing new models of natural systems to be quickly implemented and compared to existing models. Using existing technology, and teams with diverse skill sets, it is possible for ecologists to build automated forecasting systems and use them to advance our understanding of natural systems.","tags":"","title":"Developing an automated iterative near-term forecasting system for an ecological study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this tutorial, I'll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536465600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I'll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

A fundamental understanding of fear inducing sounds is important for both wildlife conservation and management because it helps us understand how to design repellents and also how (and why) animals may be negatively impacted by anthropogenic sounds. Nonlinear phenomena—sounds produced by the desynchronization of vibrations in a sound production system—are commonly found in stress-induced animal vocalizations, such as in alarm calls, mobbing calls, and fear screams. There are several functional hypotheses for these nonlinear phenomena. One specific hypothesis is the unpredictability hypothesis, which suggests that because nonlinear phenomena are more variable and somewhat unpredictable, animals are less likely to habituate to them. Animals should, therefore, have a prolonged response to sounds with nonlinear phenomena than sounds without them. Most of the studies involving nonlinear phenomena have used mammalian subjects and conspecific stimuli. Our study focused on white-crowned sparrows (_Zonotrichia leucophrys_ ssp. _oriantha_) and used synthesized acoustic stimuli to investigate behavioral responses to stimuli with and without nonlinear phenomena. We predicted that birds would be less relaxed after hearing a stimulus with a nonlinear component. We calculated the difference from baseline of proportion of time spent in relaxed behaviors and performed pair-wise comparisons between a pure tone control stimulus and each of three experimental stimuli, including a frequency jump up, a frequency jump down, and white noise. These comparisons showed that in the 30‒60 s after the playback experiment, birds were significantly less relaxed after hearing noise or an abrupt frequency jump down an octave but not an abrupt frequency jump up an octave or a pure tone. Nonlinear phenomena, therefore, may be generally arousing to animals and may explain why these acoustic properties are commonly found in animal signals associated with fear.","tags":"","title":"What is the sound of fear?
